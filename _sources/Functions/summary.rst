Summary
========
1. Like Python, C++ supports the use of functions.
2. In C++, a function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, a return type, and a body.
3. Non-fruitful functions in C++ must contain the keyword ``void`` in its function definition.
4. You can pass variables by value as well as by reference in C++ functions. Passing by reference utilizes the use of pointers.
5. Pass by reference is useful when you require a function to return multiple variables.
6. To pass an array to a function you need to use an array parameter. The array parameter is denoted by the array variable name followed by set of square brackets ([ and ]).
7. Defining a new meaning for an already existing operator (such as the arithmetic operators plus “+” or times “*”) is called overloading the operator.
8. The operators ::, #, ., and ? are reserved and cannot be overloaded.
9. Some operators such as =, [], () and -> can only be overloaded as member functions of a class and not as global functions.

Summary
=======

- Turtles, originally from the Logo programming language, is used as an educational tool. It relates to a conceptual “turtle” that runs around on a canvas and draws things.
- Python’s turtle is a great way to start coding, and until recently, C++ did not have the capability of such a library due to the complexity and required understanding of its syntax.
- Turtles have a variety of commands that are self-describing such as “forward” or “back”. Almost everything that was available to use in Python for Turtles is also available in C++.
- The two versions of the Turtle library differ mainly in syntax, such as differences in entering color codes, and the limited variety of preset shapes available in C++. However, C++ has a few extra utilities not available in Python.
- Turtles provide methods to alter their inner workings, including some control over how many frames of animation are shown with :code:`tracer` method.
- Every shape created and used by Turtles are a set of coordinates. We can change the shape of our turtles by using the :code:`shape` method to one of four default shapes, or by manually entering coordinates and creating your own.

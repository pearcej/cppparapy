While Loops
============

As we noted earlier, algorithms require two important control
structures: iteration and selection. Both of these are supported by
Python in various forms. The programmer can choose the statement that is
most useful for the given circumstance.

For repeating a block of code, C++ provides a standard ``while`` and ``for`` constructs.
The ``while`` construct repeats a body of code as long as a condition is true. For example,

::

    int counter = 1;
    while (counter <= 5) {          /*Use of an interactive method until the
                                     the loop ends   */
        cout << "Hello, world" << endl;
        counter = counter + 1;
    }

    Console output:
    Hello, world
    Hello, world
    Hello, world
    Hello, world
    Hello, world


prints out the phrase “Hello, world” five times. The condition on the
``while`` statement is evaluated at the start of each repetition. If the
condition is ``true``, the body of the statement will execute.

The ``while`` statement is a very general purpose iterative structure
that we will use in a number of different algorithms. In many cases, a
compound condition will control the iteration. A fragment such as

::

    while ((counter <= 10) && (!done)) {
    ...


would cause the body of the statement to be executed only in the case
where both parts of the condition are satisfied due to the and operator (``&&``). The value of the
variable ``counter`` would need to be less than or equal to 10 and the
value of the variable ``done`` would need to be ``false`` (``not false``
is ``true``) so that ``true and true`` results in ``true``.

Here are some of the logical operators that are useful for true-false boolean statements in C++.

::

    and          - &&

    or           - ||

    not equal to - !=

    not          - !

    greater than - >

    less than    - <

    greater than
    or equal to  - >=

    less than
    or equal to  - <=


These are the same as we saw in earlier chapters.



::

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main(){
        int counter = 0;
        while (counter <= 1) {
            cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
        }
    };


.. mchoice:: mc_whileloop
  :answer_a: "0" is written 1 time.
  :answer_b: "Hello world!" is written 1 time.
  :answer_c: "Hello world!" is written infinitely many times.
  :answer_d: None of the  above.
  :correct: c
  :feedback_a: Take a look at the cout line.
  :feedback_b: Take a closer look at the while loop
  :feedback_c: Right! because counter is never greater than one, thus making the while loop infinite.
  :feedback_d: Not quite, take another look.

  Using the code above please select the answer that should appear.

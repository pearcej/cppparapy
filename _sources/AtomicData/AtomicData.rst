Using Data in C++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C++ requires the users specify the specific data type of each variable
before it is used.
The primary C++ built-in atomic data types are: integer (``int``),
floating point (``float``), double precision floating point (``double``),
Boolean (``bool``), and character (``char``). There is also a special
type which holds a memory location called ``pointer``. C++ also has
collection or compound data types, which will be discussed in a future
chapter.

Numeric Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Numeric C++ data types include ``int`` for integer, ``float``
for floating point, ``double`` for double precision floating point.

The standard arithmetic operations, +, -, \*, and /
are used with optional parentheses to force the order of
operations away from normal operator precedence.

In Python we can use ``//`` to get integer division.
In C++, we declare all data types.
When two integers are divided in C++, the integer portion of the
quotient is returned and the fractional portion is removed.
i.e. When two integers are divided, integer division is used.
To get the whole quotient, declaring one of the numbers as a float will
convert the entire result into floating point.

Exponentiation in C++ is done using ``pow()`` from the ``cmath`` library
and the remainder (modulo) operator is done with ``%``.

Run the following code to see that you understand each result.

        using namespace std;

        // Function that perfoms various math operations
        int main(){

            cout << (2+3*4) << endl;
            cout << (2+3)*4 << endl;
            cout << pow(2, 10) << endl;
            cout << float(6)/3 << endl;
            cout << float(7)/3 << endl;
            cout << 7/3 << endl; //In C++ this is integer division
            cout << 7%3 << endl;

            print(3%6)
            print(2**100)

When declaring numeric variables in C++,
modifiers like ``short``, ``long``, and ``unsigned``
can optionally be used to help
to ensure space is used as efficiently as possible.

Boolean Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Boolean data types are named after George Boole who was an English mathematician,
so the word "Boolean" should be capitalized. However,
the Boolean data type, in C++ uses the keyword ``bool``
which is not capitalized.
The possible state values
for a C++ Boolean are lower case ``true`` and ``false``.
Be sure to note the difference in capitalization from Python.
In Python, these same truth values are capitalized, while in C++,
they are lower case.

C++ uses the standard Boolean operators, but they are represented
differently than in Python: "and" is given by ``&&`` , "or" is given by ``||``
, and "not" is given by ``!``.
Note that the internally stored values representing ``true`` and ``false``
are actually ``1`` and ``0`` respectively. Hence, we see this in output as well.

          cout << true << endl;
          cout << false << endl;
          cout << (true || false) << endl;
          cout << (true && false) << endl;

                print(True or False)
                print(True and False)
            main()


Boolean data objects are also used as results for comparison operators
such as equality (==) and greater than (:math:`>`). In addition,
relational operators and logical operators can be combined together to
form complex logical questions. :ref:`Table 1 <tab_relational>` shows the relational
and logical operators with examples shown in the session that follows.

            cout << (10 > 5) << endl;

            print(10 > 5)
            print((5 >= 1) and (5 <= 10))

        main()


When a C++ variable is declared, space in memory is set aside to hold
this type of value.
A C++ variable can optionally be initialized in the declaration by
using a combination of a declaration and an assignment statement.

Consider the following session:

.. activecode:: booleanpitfall
    :language: cpp

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    //  Demonstrates how to use variables in C++
    //  moreover, we assign an integer to a boolean variable,
    //  showing the static typing of C++.
    int main(){

        int theSum = 4;
        cout << theSum << endl;

        theSum = theSum + 1;
        cout << theSum << endl;

        bool theBool = true;
        cout << theBool << endl;

        theBool = 4;
        cout << theBool << endl;

        return 0;
    }

The declaration ``int theSum = 0;`` creates a variable called
``theSum`` and initializes it to hold the data value of ``0``.
As in Python, the right-hand side of each assignment
statement is evaluated and the resulting data value is
“assigned” to the variable named on the left-hand side.
Here the type of the variable is integer.
Because Python is dynamically typed, if the type of the data
changes in the program, so does the type of the variable.
However, in C++, the data type cannot change.
This is a characteristic of C++'s static typing. A
variable can hold ever only one type of data.
Pitfall: C++ will often simply try to do the assignment you
requested without
complaining. Note what happened in the code above in the final output.

.. mchoice:: mc_bool
   :answer_a: Setting theBool to anything other than true or false is ignored.
   :answer_b: Setting theBool to anything > 0 will be true and false otherwise.
   :answer_c: false == 0 and true = !false i.e. anything that is not zero and can be converted to a Boolean is not false, thus it must be true.
   :answer_d: None of the above.
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: No. Try changing the code and setting theBool to 0.
   :feedback_b: No. Try changing the code and setting theBool to -4.
   :feedback_c: Correct!
   :feedback_d: Try again. One of the above is correct. You might try changing the code and rerunning.

   Why did theBool output a value of 1 after being set to 4?


Character Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Python strings can be created with single or double quotes.
In C++ single quotes are used for the character (``char``) data type,
and double quotes are used for the string data type.

Consider the following code.


.. tabbed:: usingchars

  .. tab:: Python

    .. activecode:: charpy
        :caption: Python strings

        # Shows direct comparison of both Strings & Characters in Python
        def main():

            strvar = "b"
            charvar = 'b'

            print('b' == charvar)
            print("b" == strvar)
            print('a' == "a")

        main()


  .. tab:: C++

    .. activecode:: charcpp
        :caption: Considering characters and strings
        :language: cpp

        #include <iostream>
        #include <string>
        using namespace std;

        // Demonstrates how chars and strings can not be
        // directly compared.
        int main(){

            string strvar = "b";
            char charvar = 'b';

            cout << ('b' == charvar) << endl;
            cout << ("b" == strvar) << endl;
            //cout << ('a' == "a") << endl; // will error!

            return 0;
        }


Try the following question.

.. mchoice:: mc_cpp_strings
   :answer_a: ' '
   :answer_b: " "
   :answer_c: ' ' or " " may be used
   :answer_d: It depends upon the implementation.
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: No, single quotes are only used for single characters.
   :feedback_b: Good job reading!
   :feedback_c: No. Only one set of symbols may be used.
   :feedback_d: No. The implementation is consistent.
   :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.

   If I want to create a string in C++, what set of symbols may be used?


Pointers
~~~~~~~~

A C++ **pointer** is a variable that stores a memory address and can be used to indirectly
access data stored at that memory location.

We know that variables in a computer program are used to label data with a
descriptive identifier so that the data can be accessed and used by that
computer program.

Let's look at some examples of storing an integer in Python and C++.

In Python every single thing is stored as an object.
Hence, a Python variable is actually a reference to an object that is stored in memory.
Hence, each Python variable requires two memory locations:
one to store the reference, and the other to store the variable value itself in an object.

In C++ the value of each variable is stored directly in memory without the need
for either a reference or an object. This makes access faster, but it is one of
the reasons we need to declare each variable because different types take differing
amounts of space in memory!

The following code declares a variable called *varN* that has in it a
value of 100:

::

    // Python reference for a single integer value
    varN = 100

.. _fig_py_reference:

.. figure:: Figures/python_reference.png
   :align: center
   :alt: "arrow from varN to box containing 100 object"

   Figure 2.1: Python reference

::

    // C++ variable declaration and assignment of an integer value
    int varN = 100;

In C++ the results of running this code will look like the diagram below:

.. _fig_cpp_reference:

.. figure:: Figures/cpp_var.png
   :align: center
   :alt: "Location named varN containing value of 100"

   Figure 2.2: C++ variable

In each case, when we want to output the value to the console, we use the variable name
to do so.

But, we can also identify the memory location of the variable by its address.
In both Python and C++, this address
may change each time the program is run. In C++, the address will always look
odd because it will be the actual memory address written in a hexadecimal code
which is a base 16 code like 0x7ffd93f25244.
In Python it is implementation dependent,
it is sometimes a hexadecimal code and sometimes just a count or another
way to reference the address.

In Python we use ``id`` to reference the address,
while in C++ we use the *address-of operator*, ``&``.

.. tabbed:: memory-addresses

  .. tab:: C++

    .. activecode:: address_cpp
        :caption: Memory addresses in C++
        :language: cpp

        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;


        // outputs the value of a variable
        // as well as the memory address in C++.
        int main(){
            int varN = 101;
            cout << varN << endl;
            cout << &varN << endl; //outputs the memory address of variable varN
            return 0;
        }

  .. tab:: Python

    .. activecode:: address_py
        :caption: Memory identifier in Python

        # Outputs the value & memory address of
        # variable titled varN.
        def main():
            varN = 101;
            print(varN)
            print(id(varN)) # ID function returns the memory address in Python.

        main()


In both Python and C++, variables are stored in memory locations which are dependent
upon the run itself. If you repeatedly run the above code in either C++ or Python, you may
see the location change.

As suggested above, in Python, it is impossible to store a variable directly.
Instead, we must use a variable name and a reference to the data object.
(Hence the arrow in the image.)
In C++, variables store values directly, because they are faster to reference.

References are slower, but they are sometimes useful.
If in C++, we want to create a analogous reference to a memory location,
we must use a special data type called a **pointer**.

Pointer Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When declaring a pointer in C++ that will "point" to the memory address of some
data type,
you will use the same rules of declaring variables and data types.
The key difference is that there must be an asterisk (*) between the data type and the
identifier.

::

    variableType *identifier; // syntax to declare a C++ pointer
    int *ptrx; // example of a C++ pointer to an integer

White space in C++ generally does not matter, so the following pointer declarations
are identical:

::

    SOMETYPE *variablename; // preferable
    SOMETYPE * variablename;
    SOMETYPE* variablename;

However, the first declaration is preferable because it is clearer to the
programmer that the variable is in fact a pointer because the asterisk is closer
to the variable name.

The address-of operator, ``&``
------------------------------

Now that we know how to declare pointers, how do we give them the address of
where the value is going to be stored? One way to do this is to have a pointer
refer to another variable by using the address-of operator, which is denoted by the
ampersand symbol, ``&``. The address-of operator ``&`` does exactly what it indicates,
variableType varN;  // a variable to hold the value
namely it returns the address.

The syntax is shown below, where varN stores the value, and ptrN stores
the address of where varN is located:

::

    variableType *ptrN = &varN;  // a variable pointing to the address of varN

Keep in mind that when declaring a C++ pointer, the pointer needs to
reference the same type as the variable or constant to which it points.

Expanding on the example above where varN has the value of 9.

::

    //variable declaration for a single integer value
    int varN = 9;
    int *ptrN;
    ptrN = &varN;

The results of running this C++ code will look like the diagram below.

.. _fig_point2:

.. figure:: Figures/new_new_point2.png
   :align: center
   :alt: image

   Figure 2.3: View into memory with pointers

Accessing Values from Pointers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have a C++ pointer, you use the asterisk before the pointer variable,
to *dereference* the pointer, which means go to the location pointed at by the 3.

::

    In other words, varN and *ptrN (note the asterisk in front!) reference the same
    value in the code above.


Let's extend the example above to output the value of a variable and its address
in memory:

.. _dereferencing:

  .. activecode:: firstptr
      :language: cpp

      #include <iostream>
      using namespace std;

      // demonstrates what happens when you dereference a pointer
      int main( ) {
          int varN = 9;
          int *ptrN = &varN; // ptrN points to varN address

          cout << "varN value: " << varN << endl;
          cout << "varN location: " << ptrN << endl;
          cout << "dereference ptrN: " << *ptrN << endl;


          return 0;
      }


.. mchoice:: mc_pntrhlp
   :answer_a: varPntr: 9
   :answer_b: varPntr: 50
   :answer_c: varPntr: 150
   :answer_d: 0x7ffeb9ce053c
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: b
   :feedback_a: Not quite, the variable varN no longer equals 100 past line 7!
   :feedback_b: Right!
   :feedback_c: No, the values do not add together!
   :feedback_d: We are dereferencing the pointer, so you would not get the address of varN. Try again!
   :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.

   If the lines (varN = 50;) and  (cout << \*ptrN << endl;) were inserted into line 7-8, what would it cout?

Compiling and running the above code will have the program output the
value in varN,
what is in ptrN (the memory address of varN),
and what value is located at that
memory location.

The second output sentence is the address of varN, which would most likely be
different if you run the program on your machine.

WARNING: What happens if you forget the ampersand
when assigning a value to a pointer
and have the following instructions instead?

.. _cpp_address_error:

    .. activecode:: cpp_address_error1
        :language: cpp

        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main( ) {
            int varN = 100;
            int *ptrN = varN; // Note no ampersand,
                // ptrN now refers to memory position 100,
                // whatever happens to be there!
                // You might get an error or you might not!

             cout << "varN value: " << varN << endl;
             cout << "ptrN location: " << ptrN << endl;
             cout << "ptrN points to varN: " << endl;
             cout << "dereference ptrN: " << *ptrN << endl;

             return 0;
        }


**This is BAD, BAD, BAD!**

.. _fig_point3:

.. figure:: Figures/new_point_broken.png
   :align: center
   :alt: image

   Figure 2.4: dangling pointer reference

If your compiler does not catch that error (the one for this class may),
the first ``cout`` instruction outputs

::

    After changing *ptrN, varN now has: 50

which is expected because you changed where ptrN is pointing to and
NOT the contents of where it is pointing.

The second ``cout`` instruction is a disaster because
(1) You don't know what is stored in location 100 in memory, and
(2) that location is outside of your segment (area in memory reserved
for your program), so the operating system will jump in with a message
about a "segmentation fault". Although such an error message looks bad,
a "seg fault" is in fact a helpful error because unlike the elusive logical
errors, the reason is fairly localized.

The null pointer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like ``None`` in Python, the null pointer (``nullptr``) in C++ points to
nothing.  Older editions of C++ also used ``NULL`` (all caps) or 0,
but we will use the keyword ``nullptr`` because the compiler can do
better error handling with the keyword.  The null pointer is often used
in conditions and/or in logical operations.

The following example demonstrates how the null pointer works.
The variable ptrx initially has the address of x when it is declared.
On the first iteration of the loop, it is assigned the value of
``nullptr``, which evaluates to a false value; thereby ending the loop:

.. _lst_cppcode2:

    .. activecode:: NULLexamplecpp
        :language: cpp

        #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        //Shows the use of a Null pointer to represent "nothing".
        int main( ) {
            int x = 12345;
            int *ptrx = &x;

            while (ptrx) {
                cout << "Pointer ptrx points to " << &ptrx << endl;
                ptrx = nullptr;
            }

            cout << "Pointer ptrx points to nothing!\n";
        }

Helpful Tip: The null pointer becomes very useful when you must test
the state of a pointer, such as whether the assignment to an address
is valid or not.


Summary
~~~~~~~

1. All variables must be declared before use in C++.

2. C++ has typical built-in numeric types: ``int`` is for integers and ``float`` and ``double`` are used for floating point depending on the number of digits desired.

3. C++ has the Boolean type ``bool`` that holds ``true`` or ``false``.

4. The character data type ``char`` holds a single character which is encased in single quotes.

5. Pointers are a type of variable that stores a memory address. To declare a pointer, an  ``*`` is used before the variable name that is supposed to store the location.

.. mchoice:: mc_characters
   :answer_a: ' '
   :answer_b: " "
   :answer_c: ' ' or " " may be used
   :answer_d: It depends upon the implementation.
   :answer_e: none of the above
   :correct: a
   :feedback_a: Right!
   :feedback_b: No. Double quotes are only used for strings.
   :feedback_c: No. Only one set of symbols may be used.
   :feedback_d: No. The implementation is consistent.
   :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.

   If I want to use the ``char`` type in C++, what set of symbols must be used?


.. fillintheblank:: memoryvar

  A/an ``___`` is used to store a memory address in C++?

 - :pointer: Right!
   :variable: Be more specific!
   :reference: That's Python, not C++!
   :default: Incorrect. Please try again


.. mchoice:: mc_memory
  :answer_a: using ``&``
  :answer_b: using ``*``
  :answer_c: using ``id``
  :answer_d: It depends upon the implementation.
  :answer_e: none of the above
  :correct: a
  :feedback_a: Right! ``&`` is the "address-of" operator, used to reference an address.
  :feedback_b: No. ``int *p;`` defines a pointer to an integer, and ``*p`` would dereference that pointer, i.e. retrieve the data that p points to.
  :feedback_c: No. This is used in Python.
  :feedback_d: No. Try again.
  :feedback_e: One of the above is indeed correct.

  How may one reference a variable's memory address in C++?

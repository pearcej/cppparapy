Glossary
--------

.. glossary::

    `cin`
        `cin` stands for "console input". It is the standard input statement in C++.

    comment
        A comment is a programmer-readable explanation  in the source code of a computer program (``//`` single line comment, ``/**/`` Multiline comment).

    compiler
        A compiler generally transforms code written in a high-level programming language like C++ into a low-level programming language like machine code in order to create an executable program.

    `cout`
        `cout` stands for "console output". It is the standard output statement in C++.

    dynamically typed
        A dynamically typed programming languages is one in which variables need not necessarily be defined before they are used, and can change during execution.

    header
        Header files are library files that contain a variety of useful definitions. They are imported into any C++ program by using the pre-processor #include statement.

    #include

        Tells the preprocessor to treat the contents of a specified file as if they appear in the source program at the point where the directive appears.

    interpreter
        An interpreter directly executes statements in a scripting language without requiring them to have been compiled into machine language.

    machine code
        machine code is a computer program written in instructions that can be directly executed by a computer's CPU.

    statically typed
        A statically typed programming languages is one in which variables must be defined before they are used and cannot change during execution.

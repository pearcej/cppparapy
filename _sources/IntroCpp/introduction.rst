Introduction
============

This book assumes that you are already familiar with the
`Python <http://www.python.org>`_ programming language because
Python will be the starting point for our journey into C++. We will begin by
looking at a very simple C++ program to see how the C++ language
looks, and we will discuss how we get a C++ program to run. 

Next, we will look at the primary constructs that are common 
to nearly all programming languages:

    -  Using code libraries
    
    -  Documenting with comments 
    
    -  The main function
    
    -  Writing output to the screen
    
    -  Reading input from the keyboard
   
    -  Data types and operators
    
    -  Conditionals

    -  Loops

Once we have the basics of C++ behind us we will move on to look at the
additonal useful features of C++ including:

    -  Functions and their parameters

    -  File operations

    -  Exception handling

Please note that this book is a work in progress. 
Updates and new versions are likely to be forthcoming.

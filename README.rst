C++ for Python Programmers
==========================

This short ebook is intended to make it easy for anyone with at least some background
in Python to transition to programming in C++.
Portions of this book began as *Java for Python Programmers* by Brad Miller.
These sections were translated to C++ by Jan Pearce and a team of excellent Berea
College students in 2018 and early 2019. Other portions of this book began as
web pages written by Jan Pearce as support for a Berea College C++ programming class.
Still other sections were newly written by Jan Pearce for this ebook.

We are very grateful to Berea College student Jesse Walker-Schadler.
 In the summer of 2019 Jesse wrote an excellent wrapper
for the CImg library that would allow graphics in C++ to utilize commands like
the Turtle library in Python. In the summer of 2020 he led the incorporation into
this book.

We are also particularly grateful to Runestone for the excellent framework for
ebooks that facilitate running both C++ and Python in the browser.

Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.

1. You can see and read this book online at
   `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/cpp4py/index.html>`_

2.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install git+git://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneComponents.git``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/cpp4py``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/cpp4py``
